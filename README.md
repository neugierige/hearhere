# hearhere
Final project for MOB 

HearHere was imagined as a comprehensive arts calendar for New York, with a focus on innovative work by local artists and startup organizations and ensembles. The goal of the app is to help adventurous culturevores to discover art that they may not otherwise be exposed to. 

The app's functionality includes several features that allow users to find information about performances, and to narrow down the selection to match his/her interests. Upon downloading the app, new users are prompted to select tags that match his/her preferences, which allows the home tab to produce events that reflect the user's interests. The Calendar tab allows users to view all events available in the database, with the use of a horizontal scrolling date picker. The Map tab allows users to see events based on location, since many events happen at locations that are not widely known as performance venues. 

This app was conceived and designed by Lu Xing. Development work done by Matthew Korporaal, Prima Prasertrat, and Lu Xing.
